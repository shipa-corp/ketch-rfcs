# Ketch RFCs
If you have a suggestion to change or improve [Ketch](https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch) we welcome your ideas! The following document outlines how to submit your proposal to the Ketch community for consideration.

## Summary
We follow a Request for Comments (RFC) process to provide a consistent, community driven process for new features to be added to the [Ketch](https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch) tool. The process provides the means to vet suggestions from the community as well as a version controlled history of the project as it evolves. Many changes such as bug fixes do not require submitting an RFC and can be implemented by submitting a standard pull request; however, the RFC process is in place for more substantial changes or improvements that are beyond the scope of the standard pull request.
## Process
In order to get a proposal accepted in Ketch an RFC needs to be created and merged into this RFC repository.  Once an RFC is merged it is considered active and may be implemented in the Ketch project. The following steps outline the method for creating an RFC and getting it merged.
 

1. Fork this repo: [https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch-rfcs](https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch-rfcs).
2. Copy `0000-template.md` into `text/0000-my-feature.md.`
3. Fill in the RFC, describing your feature. Use N/A if any section isn't applicable.
4. Submit a pull request.
5. Fill free to discuss your proposal with others and integrate feedback.  [Ketch Slack](https://theketch.slack.com)

### Development

Once you submit your PR your RFC is in development. Your proposal will be discussed in the next Ketch office hours, [Zoom Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88017635184), which occur weekly on Wednesday 8:30 to 9:30 Pacific Time.  When your proposal is ready it will be moved into a Final Comment Period along with the proposed outcome which will be one of *merge, close or postpone*.
### Final Comment Period
The FCP will last no longer than seven days. At the end of this period a vote will decide on the final disposition of the RFC. The disposition is decided by a super majority of the maintainer team although community votes will be considered and are welcome. If no new arguments or issues or raised the RFC will follow the outcome decided. Otherwise the RFC status will return to development.  
### Merge
Once the RFC is accepted issues will be created that link back to the pull request.  The PR is merged by a maintainer and work is scheduled to implement the PR as necessary.
